# MMM-MovieListings
Displays the top 20 movies that are currently in theaters around you. The list is fetched from [The Movie Database](https://themoviedb.org).
The module determines whether it's on the left or right side of the mirror and displays accordingly (image in poster mode mode will always be on the side of the mirror's edge):

## Install
`cd ~/MagicMirror/modules`

`git clone https://github.com/mumblebaj/MMM-MovieListings.git`

## Dependencies
None. Uses MagicMirrorÂ² builtin fetch

## Updates

### v1.1.0
- Removed the `list` option as the visual for it not very apealing.
- Fixe issue with `cast` which was not updating for each new movie passed in
- Changed and simplified the way in which movies were being fetched and displayed

### v1.0.0
- The Movie DB has made changes to the way in which they authenticate the different API used by the module. The API key now no longer supports all APi's. As such, the module has been updated to make use of the `API Read Access Token` instead.
- Have removed `request` and updated to makse use of the internal fetch module instead.
